## ðŸš€ Setup CMS

1.  **Clone Strapi CMS**

    Clone [cakraz-emlak-cms](https://github.com/oktay/cakraz-emlak-cms) for backend and content managment. **Follow instructions in the [`cakraz-emlak-cms/README.md`](https://github.com/oktay/cakraz-emlak-cms/README.md) file.**

    # clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/oktay/cakraz-emlak-cms
    cd cakraz-emlak-cms

    yarn develop
    ```

    Your backend/cms is now running at `http://localhost:1337`!
    
    *Note: If your first time, you need create admin user, create **at least one content for each content type** and activate **`find`**, **`findone`** permissions for content types **otherwise you cant run gatsby server.***
